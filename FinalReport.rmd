# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

A new  preventative aides drug (triUmpsal) is under test in clinical trials. Consider only the DrugUsers, does this drug seem effective?  Hint - use dplyr to obtain that subpopulation with the filter command.

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

```{r include=FALSE}
drug_user <- filter(triUmp,DrugUser =="yes")
```

We will use the Dyplr tool filter to create a subset of the data, Storing only data where drug user = yes. Graphical, numerical, and inferential to test the nul hypothesis 

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->

```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=drug_user)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=drug_user, type="percent")
```

The people who ended up with aids, most of them had been given the placebo. With the people who were not given anything, the results are about the same. This shows us that the vaccine is working against contracting aids. 

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=drug_user)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

In the row percents, 25% of the people got aids with the vaccine while 75% had the placebo. With those who did not contract aids, 48% took the drug and 52% took the placebo

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
```

```{r}
chisqtestGC(table1)
```

```{r}
fisher.test(table1)
```

In our results, it tells us that we had 34 people out of 140 who got aids with the drug and the other 106 did with the placebo. Out of the 2,402 people who did not get aids, 1143 of them were given the drug and the other 1259 were given the placebo. There is a chance of 0.0000000423 of getting these results for the Chi-squared test. With the Fisher's Exact test shows us that the odds ratio is 0.35. 

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->

Looking at the data from above we were able to identify that drug users who were given a drug versus a placebo were still able to contract aids. There was a 3:1 ratio from placebo to drug which shows that the drug lowered the rate but did not stop the infection. With those who had not contracted aids there was 48% who were given the drug and 52% who were given the placebo.
